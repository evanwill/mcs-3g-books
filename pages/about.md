## About the Collection

This collection was created by MCS third graders who cataloged books from their classroom, in collaboration with [a librarian](http://vivo.nkn.uidaho.edu/vivo/individual/n43629). 

Each student used a [metadata form]({{ '/assets/img/book_metadata.pdf' | relative_url }}) to record information about their chosen book. 
Some drew a picture to illustrate the story. 

These forms were scanned to provide digital images for the collection website.

Then the book information was transferred into a spreadsheet.
The spreadsheet is used to build the digital collection website.
